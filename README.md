===================

A minimalist interpreter

The "compile" file is used to easily compile the lexical analyser (lex, interpreter.x) and the grammar rules (yacc, interpreter.y) and to link the two together.

To develop easily, simply make the necessary changes on the .l and the .y files and do a "./compile" on the terminal.
